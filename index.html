                The Royal Jordanian Armed Forces, also referred to as the Arab Army, are the regular armed forces of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The Jordanian Armed Forces consist of the Royal Jordanian Land Forces, the Royal Jordanian Navy and the Royal Jordanian Air Force.

In order to better deal with a host of potential threats, Jordan has reorganized its armed forces. Most of the focus was on rapid response and special forces, and the Special Operations Command (SOCOM), which was established in the mid-1990s, focused on homeland security, and border security in support of the Middle East peace process. Finally, the Special Operations Command pays special attention to smuggling operations on the Iraqi border, and infiltration operations from the Syrian border. It also focuses more specifically on sensitive areas with the West Bank. Jordan has been a strong supporter of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and has forces participating in these missions in several regions around the world.
                Date
The emergence of the Arab Army goes back to the elite of Jordanians of the Great Arab Revolution who left with Prince Abdullah bin Al Hussein and joined him in the Hijaz for the independence of Jordan and the Levant from the Ottoman Empire, where Prince Abdullah worked to form the first national government in Transjordan on April 11, 1921, The Emir called the Jordanian Armed Forces the name of the Arab Army since 1923. The Arab Army is a term applied only to the Jordanian Armed Forces since its establishment in the era of the Emirate of Transjordan, and after the Arabization of the leadership of the Jordanian Arab Army at the hands of the late King Hussein bin Talal in 1956 AD until today. King Abdullah the First called the Arab Army the first military force in the Transjordan region in 1921, when several combat groups that were fighting in the Great Arab Revolt were united, in addition to military groups that were affiliated with the local governments that were established in 1920.

Arabization of the leadership of the Arab army
The Arabization of the leadership of the Jordanian army is the historic decision of King Hussein bin Talal on the first of March 1956, in coordination with the Jordanian Free Officers Movement, to exempt the commander of the Arab army, the English officer Globe Pasha, from his post, in addition to exempting all English officers from their duties that were granted to them in the 1946 agreement.

Britain has been a mandatory state on Transjordan since 1921. After independence in 1946, it signed an agreement with Jordan providing for British control over the highest positions in the army. In the 1950s, tension increased between King Hussein bin Talal and Klop Pasha, in addition to an increase in hatred for the foreign presence in the country. And at dawn on the first of March, King Hussein bin Talal made his historic decision to Arabize the leadership of the Arab army from the foreign presence and issued his high order to the members of the Free Officers Organization to implement the immediate departure of Globe Pasha. Since then, Jordanian officers have taken over all positions of the Jordanian Arab Army.

This decision led to a tense relationship with the United States and Britain on the one hand, and an improvement in relations with Egypt and Syria on the other hand. This decision also had a major role in Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser’s decision to nationalize the Suez Canal after 6 months of Arabizing the leadership of the Arab army.

                His Majesty King Abdullah II ascended the Throne of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 7 February 1999, on the day his father, His Majesty King Hussein Bin Talal, may his soul rest in peace, passed away. King Abdullah II is the 41st generation direct descendant of Prophet Mohammad, peace and blessings be upon him.

The eldest son of King Hussein Bin Talal and Princess Muna Al Hussein, His Majesty was born in Amman on 30 January 1962. King Abdullah II has four brothers and six sisters. His Majesty received elementary education at the Islamic Educational College in Amman, enrolling in 1966; and then attended Saint Edmund’s School in Surrey, Britain, before attending Eaglebrook School and Deerfield Academy in the United States to complete secondary education.

Within training as an officer in the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army, the King joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom in 1980. His Majesty was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant after completing military education there. The King was then appointed as commander of a scouting company in the 13/18 battalion of the British Royal Hussars. In 1982, His Majesty completed a one-year special studies course on the Middle East at Oxford University.

Upon return to Jordan, King Abdullah II enlisted in the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Armywith the rank of first lieutenant; and then served as a platoon commander and assistant commander of a company in the 40th Armoured Brigade. In 1985, His Majesty attended an advanced armour course in Fort Knox, Kentucky in the United States.

In 1986, the King became commander of a tank company, with the rank of Captain in the 91st Armoured Brigade of the Armed Forces. His Majesty also served in the anti-tank helicopter wing in the Royal Jordanian Air Force, after obtaining qualification as a paratrooper in military freefall and as a Cobra Attack Helicopter pilot.

In 1987, the King attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and undertook advanced study and research in International Affairs within the framework of the master’s programme in Foreign Service.

His Majesty served as assistant commander of a company in the 17th Royal Tank Battalion, and was later promoted to the rank of Major. King Abdullah II also attended a staff course at the Staff College, Camberley in the UK.

In the period 1991-1992, the King represented the Armoured Corp at the Office of the Inspector General of the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army. His Majesty also led the Second Royal Armoured Battalion; and in 1993 was promoted to Colonel, taking over as Commander of the 40th Armoured Brigade. King Abdullah II later became Assistant Commander of the Royal Jordanian Special Forces, before taking over as Commander with the rank of Brigadier General. In 1996, the King restructured the Special Forces in 1996 to form elite units and create the Special Forces Command. His Majesty was promoted to Major General in 1998; and in June and July of the same year, attended a course on administering defence resources in the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

In addition to military service, the King served as regent several times in the absence of His Majesty King Hussein, may his soul rest in peace. On 29 January 1999, His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein was appointed Crown Prince by Royal Decree. King Abdullah II had previously been named Crown Prince by a Royal Decree that was issued - in accordance with Article 28 of the Constitution - at birth, on 30 January 1962, which was effective until 1 April 1965.

His Majesty married Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah on 10 June 1993. They have two sons - His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein, born on 28 June 1994, and His Royal Highness Prince Hashem, born on 30 January 2005 - and two daughters - Her Royal Highness Princess Iman, born on 27 September 1996 and Her Royal Highness Princess Salma, born on 26 September 2000.

                  [T]he best resource for those who wish to travel along the straight path in their words and their actions, and in their spiritual and religious life’.

— The Grand Shaykh of the Azhar, Shaykh Mohammed Sayyid Tantawi (may God have mercy on him), 2006.

The Amman Message started as a detailed statement released the eve of the 27th of Ramadan 1425 AH / 9th November 2004 CE by H.M. King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein in Amman, Jordan. It sought to declare what Islam is and what it is not, and what actions represent it and what actions do not. Its goal was to clarify to the modern world the true nature of Islam and the nature of true Islam.

In order to give this statement more religious authority, H.M. King Abdullah II then sent the following three questions to 24 of the most senior religious scholars from all around the world representing all the branches and schools of Islam: (1) Who is a Muslim? (2) Is it permissible to declare someone an apostate (takfir)? (3) Who has the right to undertake issuing fatwas (legal rulings)?

Based on the fatwas provided by these great scholars (who included the Shaykh Al-Azhar; Ayatollah Sistani and Sheikh Qaradawi), in July 2005 CE, H.M. King Abdullah II convened an international Islamic conference of 200 of the world’s leading Islamic scholars ‘Ulama) from 50 countries. In Amman, the scholars unanimously issued a ruling on three fundamental issues (which became known as the ‘Three Points of the Amman Message’):

They specifically recognized the validity of all 8 Mathhabs (legal schools) of Sunni, Shi’a andIbadhi Islam; of traditional Islamic Theology (Ash’arism); of Islamic Mysticism (Sufism), and of true Salafi thought, and came to a precise definition of who is a Muslim.
Based upon this definition they forbade takfir (declarations of apostasy) between Muslims.
Based upon the Mathahib they set forth the subjective and objective preconditions for the issuing of fatwas, thereby exposing ignorant and illegitimate edicts in the name of Islam.
These Three Points were then unanimously adopted by the Islamic World’s political and temporal leaderships at the Organization of the Islamic Conference summit at Mecca in December 2005. And over a period of one year from July 2005 to July 2006, the Three Points were also unanimously adopted by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies, culminating with the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. In total, over 500 leading Muslim scholars worldwide—as can be seen on this website [click here to see the entire list]—unanimously endorsed the Amman Message and its Three Points.

This amounts to a historical, universal and unanimous religious and political consensus (ijma’) of theUmmah (nation) of Islam in our day, and a consolidation of traditional, orthodox Islam. The significance of this is: (1) that it is the first time in over a thousand years that the Ummah has formally and specifically come to such a pluralistic mutual inter-recognition; and (2) that such a recognition is religiously legally binding on Muslims since the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: My Ummah will not agree upon an error (Ibn Majah, Sunan, Kitab al-Fitan, Hadithno.4085).

This is good news not only for Muslims, for whom it provides a basis for unity and a solution to infighting, but also for non-Muslims. For the safeguarding of the legal methodologies of Islam (theMathahib) necessarily means inherently preserving traditional Islam’s internal ‘checks and balances’. It thus assures balanced Islamic solutions for essential issues like human rights; women’s rights; freedom of religion; legitimate jihad; good citizenship of Muslims in non-Muslim countries, and just and democratic government. It also exposes the illegitimate opinions of radical fundamentalists and terrorists from the point of view of true Islam. As George Yeo, the Foreign Minister of Singapore, declared in the 60th Session of the U.N. General Assembly (about the Amman Message): “Without this clarification, the war against terrorism would be much harder to fight.”

Finally, whilst this by the Grace of God is a historical achievement, it will clearly remain only principial unless it is put into practice everywhere. For this reason, H.M. King Abdullah II is now seeking to implement it, God willing, through various pragmatic measures, including (1) inter-Islamic treaties; (2) national and international legislation using the Three Points of the Amman Message to define Islam and forbid takfir; (3) the use of publishing and the multi-media in all their aspects to spread the Amman Message; (4) instituting the teaching of the Amman Message in school curricula and university courses worldwide; and (5) making it part of the training of mosqueImams and making it included in their sermons.

God says in the Holy Qur’an says:

There is no good in much of their secret conferences save (in) whosoever enjoineth charity and fairness and peace-making among the people and whoso doeth that, seeking the good pleasure of God, We shall bestow on him a vast reward. (Al-Nisa,4:114).
